(*
Workspaces allow convenient live code evaluation in the Newspeak IDE. They provide access to an IDE namespace,
unconstrained by the scope of a single module.  This module implements workspaces in the IDE. It lacks much of
the functionality of the Newspeak-on-Squeak workspaces due to the impoverishment of the web platform.

This is also very much a work in progress. Because we don't yet support adding classes, we rely on the simple expedient of having a single Workspace class without custom subclasses.
